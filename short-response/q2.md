# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer
The benefits of an SPA is that after the page first loads, new requests won't have to be made to the server if the user wants to access different parts of the app. This makes for a smoother user-experience. 

The benefits of an MPA is they make search engine optimization easier and they they're better at handling browser history.
