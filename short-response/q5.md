With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

The third path because you start with `/products` which would direct a user to the endpoint for all the products and `products/5` would direct you to the product with the id of 5.
